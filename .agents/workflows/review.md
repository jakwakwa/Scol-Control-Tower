# Review Command

<command_purpose> Perform exhaustive code reviews using multi-agent analysis, ultra-thinking, and Git worktrees for deep local inspection. </command_purpose>

## Introduction

<role>Senior Code Review Architect with expertise in security, performance, architecture, and quality assurance</role>

## Prerequisites

<requirements>
- Git repository with GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Clean main/master branch
- Proper permissions to create worktrees and access the repository
- For document reviews: Path to a markdown file or document
</requirements>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Determine Review Target & Setup (ALWAYS FIRST)

<review_target> #$ARGUMENTS </review_target>

<thinking>
First, I need to determine the review target type and set up the code for analysis.
</thinking>

#### Immediate Actions:

<task_list>

- [ ] Determine review type: PR number (numeric), GitHub URL, file path (.md), or empty (current branch)
- [ ] Check current git branch
- [ ] If ALREADY on the target branch (PR branch, requested branch name, or the branch already checked out for review) → proceed with analysis on current branch
- [ ] If DIFFERENT branch than the review target → offer to use worktree: "Use git-worktree skill for isolated Call `skill: git-worktree` with branch name
- [ ] Fetch PR metadata using `gh pr view --json` for title, body, files, linked issues
- [ ] Set up language-specific analysis tools
- [ ] Prepare security scanning environment
- [ ] Make sure we are on the branch we are reviewing. Use gh pr checkout to switch to the branch or manually checkout the branch.

Ensure that the code is ready for analysis (either in worktree or on current branch). ONLY then proceed to the next step.

</task_list>

#### Protected Artifacts

<protected_artifacts>
The following paths are compound-engineering pipeline artifacts and must never be flagged for deletion, removal, or gitignore by any review agent:

- `docs/plans/*.md` — Plan files created by `/workflows:plan`. These are living documents that track implementation progress (checkboxes are checked off by `/workflows:work`).
- `docs/solutions/*.md` — Solution documents created during the pipeline.

If a review agent flags any file in these directories for cleanup or removal, discard that finding during synthesis. Do not create a todo for it.
</protected_artifacts>

#### Load Review Agents

Read `compound-engineering.local.md` in the project root. If found, use `review_agents` from YAML frontmatter. If the markdown body contains review context, pass it to each agent as additional instructions.

If no settings file exists, invoke the `setup` skill to create one. Then read the newly created file and continue.

#### Parallel Agents to review the PR:

<parallel_tasks>

Run all configured review agents in parallel using Task tool. For each agent in the `review_agents` list:

```
Task {agent-name}(PR content + review context from settings body)
```

Additionally, always run these regardless of settings:
- Task agent-native-reviewer(PR content) - Verify new features are agent-accessible
- Task learnings-researcher(PR content) - Search docs/solutions/ for past issues related to this PR's modules and patterns

</parallel_tasks>

#### Conditional Agents (Run if applicable):

<conditional_agents>

These agents are run ONLY when the PR matches specific criteria. Check the PR files list to determine if they apply:

**MIGRATIONS: If PR contains database migrations, schema.rb, or data backfills:**

- Task schema-drift-detector(PR content) - Detects unrelated schema.rb changes by cross-referencing against included migrations (run FIRST)
- Task data-migration-expert(PR content) - Validates ID mappings match production, checks for swapped values, verifies rollback safety
- Task deployment-verification-agent(PR content) - Creates Go/No-Go deployment checklist with SQL verification queries

**When to run:**
- PR includes files matching `db/migrate/*.rb` or `db/schema.rb`
- PR modifies columns that store IDs, enums, or mappings
- PR includes data backfill scripts or rake tasks
- PR title/body mentions: migration, backfill, data transformation, ID mapping

**What these agents check:**
- `schema-drift-detector`: Cross-references schema.rb changes against PR migrations to catch unrelated columns/indexes from local database state
- `data-migration-expert`: Verifies hard-coded mappings match production reality (prevents swapped IDs), checks for orphaned associations, validates dual-write patterns
- `deployment-verification-agent`: Produces executable pre/post-deploy checklists with SQL queries, rollback procedures, and monitoring plans

</conditional_agents>

### 4. Ultra-Thinking Deep Dive Phases

<ultrathink_instruction> For each phase below, spend maximum cognitive effort. Think step by step. Consider all angles. Question assumptions. And bring all reviews in a synthesis to the user.</ultrathink_instruction>

#### Phase 3: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Put yourself in each stakeholder's shoes. What matters to them? What are their pain points? </thinking_prompt>

<stakeholder_perspectives>

1. **Developer Perspective** <questions>

   - How easy is this to understand and modify?
   - Are the APIs intuitive?
   - Is debugging straightforward?
   - Can I test this easily? </questions>

2. **Operations Perspective** <questions>

   - How do I deploy this safely?
   - What metrics and logs are available?
   - How do I troubleshoot issues?
   - What are the resource requirements? </questions>

3. **End User Perspective** <questions>

   - Is the feature intuitive?
   - Are error messages helpful?
   - Is performance acceptable?
   - Does it solve my problem? </questions>

4. **Security Team Perspective** <questions>

   - What's the attack surface?
   - Are there compliance requirements?
   - How is data protected?
   - What are the audit capabilities? </questions>

5. **Business Perspective** <questions>
   - What's the ROI?
   - Are there legal/compliance risks?
   - How does this affect time-to-market?
   - What's the total cost of ownership? </questions> </stakeholder_perspectives>

#### Phase 4: Scenario Exploration

<thinking_prompt> ULTRA-THINK: Explore edge cases and failure scenarios. What could go wrong? How does the system behave under stress? </thinking_prompt>

<scenario_checklist>

- [ ] **Happy Path**: Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] **Invalid Inputs**: Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] **Scale Testing**: 10x, 100x, 1000x normal load
- [ ] **Network Issues**: Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, disk, connections
- [ ] **Security Attacks**: Injection, overflow, DoS
- [ ] **Data Corruption**: Partial writes, inconsistency
- [ ] **Cascading Failures**: Downstream service issues </scenario_checklist>
